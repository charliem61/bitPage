Bit Coin Project

Repo Link: https://github.com/charliem61/bitPage

Live Url: https://github.com/charliem61/bitPage.git

Goal/Motivation:

    When the user logs onto our site, 9 different crypto currencies will be displayed for the user to choose from.
    Each different crypto currency will have its own data displayed once the user clicks on that card desired. Each card will display recent price changes, current price, price an hour ago, a day ago, and a week ago.

    If user wants to save their favorite coins to a list, they can hit a button to favorite their coins desired.

Problems Solved:

    9 individual crypto coins have been applied to the page using a free web api. With this api we have displayed current market price for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Tether, Solana, Usd-Coin, Ripple, Cardano, Terra-Luna. Along with the hourly, daily, and weekly price changes.

    The user also has the ability to favorite their top favorite coins to save to local storage.

The Standout:

    Each coin has live market data displayed to the module along with the coins image and title. The favorite feature also makes the page have the ability to personalize the users own preferances.

Challenges Faced:

    Ensuring the local storage to work with the users preference selected.

    The api applied was layed out as an array which left the specified coins we wanted tough to display.
